# Masjid Tsukuba
Masjid Tsukuba is the first Masjid in Tsukuba city, Ibaraki-ken. It is unique in that all muslim communities gather in this masjid regardless of mazhab or nationality.
Ultimately masjid is only for Allah, so we should not call other stuffs with Allah inside the Masjid (QS Al Jinn).
